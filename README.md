# HighFrequencyTwister
These are all the source code and design files for High Frequency Twister, the Rubik's Cube solving robot built by Jay Flatland and Paul Rose that set the World Record at 0.900s on February 5, 2016.

Primary files include:
* FreeCAD drawings for 3D printed parts
* Arduino sketch for stepper motor controller
* C++ code for the solving application
* Various other cruft we collected along the way

The code is a mess, but it got the job done.  We meant to organize this better before releasing, but never got around to it and decided to just publish it as-is rather than delaying any more.
